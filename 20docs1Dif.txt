designed end israeli racial discrimination meanwhile united state behalf israel exerting heavy pressure member state united nation repeal resolution give israeli racial practice zionism moral legitimacy principle advocating un intervention via operative statement case must therefore hold applied case council perceives form racial discrimination previously exhibited scarey thought definition israel state belonging jew world inhabitant alienates native non jew born country actually know quite native non jew born israel alienated law said would probably correct however tendency exagerate slant fact becomes apparent slant permeates text practically non jew living originate area israeli control identify palestinian muslim many christian jew including author line also identify palestinian statement true practically discounting beduin circassian druze fringe group identification matter bearing upon issue could equally identify insert group zionism took europe end last century aim create jewish state palestine spite adamant opposition palestinian arab 95 population recall correctly time zionism took adamant opposition palestine open factual contradictory evidence zionist powerful militarily economically technologically succeeded 1948 conquering 70 area mandatory palestine driving exile native arab conquered area approximately 750 000 people razing village
